### How to use our app

#### To begin using our code, first download it using the link below. Using Unreal Engine 5.4.4, open our UEProject called FirstVRProject. Once the project opens, it will land you on the basic VR Template page. Open the content browser, and select 'My Levels' and then 'level_2'. Once level_2 opens, connect the headset to the pen and controllers, then connect them to the PC you are running the project on using the 'Link Cable'. Once everything is hooked up, select the 'Play this level in VR' button at the top or combo 'Alt+P' together. This will start the application. Once in the app you are able to: Teleport using the right joystick, Draw on the whiteboards using the right trigger, Draw in 3D space using the right grip, and Delete 3D art using the left trigger.

#### Note: the computer in which you test on can influence the number of pixels drawn per second. Very poor performace can make 2d sketching vary with some performance hitches causing large gaps between each drawn pixel

## Information about how the project went

### Noah - During the later 3/4ths of the semester we asked Prof. Ortega if we could drop the 'hand tracking' portion of our project. We had issues with the UE5 hand tracking showcase and the version of UE5 that it was built in. It was only compatable for UE5.3.4 while some of our other dependencies like the MetaXR plugin was not compatable for UE5.3.4 and instead only compatable for UE5.4.4.
### This set us back pretty far as we were stuck for a long time getting hand tracking working and trying to figure out how to implement it ourself using the basic handtracking that the 'Meta Developer' plugins provided. This meant learning complex linear algebra to determine different hand gestures and the distances between bones in the hand. I spent a considerable ammout of time trying to solve this problem that could have been spent on researching and creating our final prototype.
