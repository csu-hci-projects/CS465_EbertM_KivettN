# Noah Kivett & Max Ebert Semester Project

At the current stage of our project we are trying to gather as much research as possible. We have recieved our headset and pen and will begin testing after spring break. We Have not communicated that we need access to the NUILAB pen gesture libraries as a starting point of our code. Neither of us have much experience using Unity but we both are currently watching youtube videos and trying to build up some knowlege with our homework 1 assignment.
